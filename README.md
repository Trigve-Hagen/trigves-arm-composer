# trigves-arm
This is a Rapid Application Development tool designed to speed up the work flow by taking out the need to run back and forth from the database. It works on database tables and rows by mapping a multidementional array to the relational database the same way an Orm maps an object. Once installed place the $this_>ArmCheckTables(); function somewhere where it will be ran everytime your page refreshes. If updates are needed it does them automatically. This branch is for custom php projects that run on your home made architectures. I will be updating it with new features and creating other branchs for symfony, laravel and code-igniter.

YOU REALLY HAVE TO WATCH WHEN YOU ARE CREATING YOUR TABLES AND FIELDS  
 * NAMING TWO ROWS THE SAME WILL HALT EXECUTION AND CREATE AN ERROR  
 * NO TWO FIELDS IN A TABLE CAN HAVE THE SAME NAME  
 * NAMING TWO TABLES THE SAME WILL HALT EXECUTION AND CREATE AN ERROR  
 * NO TWO TABLES CAN HAVE THE SAME NAME 
 * SQL WILL TURN THE TABLE NAMES THAT HAVE UPPERCASE CHARACTERS TO LOWER CASES AND YOUR ARRAY WON'T MATCH THE DATABASES
 * STICK TO LOWER CASE IN THE SECTIONS THAT HAVE LOWER CASE AND ONLY USE UPPER CASE WHEN TYPING THE ROW
 * UNLESS YOU WANT TO MESS WITH IT FOR YOUR PURPOSES!!!

 * IT WAS ERRORING ON LOCALHOST BECAUSE I HAD THE TABLE NAMES INCLUDING UPPER CASE CHARACTERS. WHEN IT CREATED THE DATABASES IT TURNED THEM TO LOWER CASE. THEN WHEN I CHECKED MY $_tablesArray (UPPER CASE) AGAINST THE DATABASE ARRAY(LOWWER CASE) IT RETURNED NOT IN THE ARRAY AND DELETED THEM BOTH. - users_c3p0r2d2007OG - has to be users_c3p0r2d2007og

Due to adding new features to the class last week I was running into new errors. When debbugging I realized the new error was not a new error at all but this. If you had named two databases the same they would both be erased when dropping a table. I added new logic for reporting the error. I also adding logic to report having two rows with the same name and errors and messages for everything else. PLease be carefull anyways. I take no responsibility for lost data! Use at your risk. If I have no new problems to report in the next month of developing with it than it is done. Happy Coding!!
